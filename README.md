# üìö LeetCode Projects  

A collection of solutions to problems I have attempted on **LeetCode**. This repository serves as a personal archive for improving coding skills, mastering **data structures** and **algorithms**, and gaining familiarity with **Python**.

---

## üìù About  
This repository contains my implementations for various coding problems solved on **LeetCode**.  

### Initial Purpose  
When I started this repository, my primary goal was to familiarize myself with Python and learn how different functions and techniques worked. As a result, some solutions may not be optimized for **time** or **space complexity**.  

### Current Focus  
I am revisiting the solutions to improve:  
- **Code efficiency** through optimizations.  
- My understanding of **advanced data structures** and **algorithms**.  
- Problem-solving skills across varying levels of difficulty.
